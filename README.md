# Agarian-2.github.io
An experimental client for my agar.io server.

Things to note:
 - This client can be used for any agar.io server (assuming it's MultiOgar based).
 - Skins are broken at the moment.
 - I am not in a position to help anybody who has an issue with my client, unless I find it necessary.
 - This client is NOT owned by me (the original is located at https://github.com/Luka967/Cigar).
 - Updates will usually come often.

What's new (mostly options):
 - Option to hide cell borders.
 - Option to hide grid.
 - Option for infinite mouse scroll zoom.
 - Option for transparent cells.
 - Option to show map border lines.
 - Option to show map sectors.
 - Option to show your (X,Y) coordinates.
 - Option to remove the black outline around names.
 - Option to change your text color on the leaderboard.
 - Option to change your name color.
 - Option to change your cell border color.
 - Option to change your cell border size.
 - Option to hide food cells (for lower end PC's).
 - Minimap draws all your cells.
 - Some 'important' links for you to check out.
 - Some small optimizations here-and-there.
 - My Discord name will now be red...
 - Adjusted leaderboard (looks much more like agar.io's leaderboard).
